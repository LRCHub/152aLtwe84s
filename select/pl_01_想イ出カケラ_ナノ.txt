The city starts to fade
into the setting sun
as I turn my back
and walk the lonely road
I felt your hand slip through
my fingers once again and
what was left
was just a momentary warmth
Every time I felt your touch,
it would seep into my heart
if I could hold you
for a little longer
and the lingering scent
as you whispered in my ear
would fade forever
in the vivid sky
I hear the sound of your voice,
I hear it echo inside my dreams
turning into memories
as they start to fall away
and the tears that I cry,
washed away by the rain
I promise this is where I'll be,
waiting for you
Without a sound the days
are slowly passing by
and the night
is like a story without an end
The only light that
shines upon the quiet world
are the stars
and they will lead me
back to you
As I find another piece
of a memory inside
as the story grows
a little longer
and the look on your face
as you waved your hand goodbye
would fade forever
in the darkened sky
I drown inside these memories,
I feel them fall from the sky
above
washing everything away
and staining me in gray
but I will stand in the rain,
until I know that I've found you
this is where I'll always be,
waiting for you
I hear the sound of your voice,
I hear it echo inside my dreams
turning into memories
as they start to fall away
and the tears that I cry,
washed away by the rain
I promise this is where I'll be,
waiting for you
waiting for you
waiting for you
